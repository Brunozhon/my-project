## joker

The joker file is used for telling simple jokes by the joke(q, a) function.

### how it works

1. When you press the button, it actvates the onclick function and passes to the "=" sign and then to  the "joke(q, a)" function with quotes surronding it.

2. The function runs the code below:

var jokeUser1 = "";

while (jokeUser1 != a) {
  
  jokeUser1 = prompt(q);
  
}

alert("Great job!");
